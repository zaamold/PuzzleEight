# PuzzleEight
#### Zachary Aamold

This project is a simple Puzzle Eight program created as a personal challenge. I created it with the idea of having a single point of maintenance in mind, so you can change any of these values and the program will still work correctly:
- The size of the image
- The image itself (given the file path)
- The number of tiles there are per row
